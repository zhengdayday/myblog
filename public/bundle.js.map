If there is no\n\tcrypto support, seedrandom() uses the current time, the native rng,\n\tand a walk of several DOM objects to collect a few bits of entropy.\n\t\n\tEach time the one- or two-argument forms of seedrandom are called,\n\tentropy from the passed seed is accumulated in a pool to help generate\n\tfuture seeds for the zero- and two-argument forms of seedrandom.\n\t\n\tOn speed - This javascript implementation of Math.random() is several\n\ttimes slower than the built-in Math.random() because it is not native\n\tcode, but that is typically fast enough.  Some details (timings on\n\tChrome 25 on a 2010 vintage macbook):\n\t\n\t* seeded Math.random()          - avg less than 0.0002 milliseconds per call\n\t* seedrandom('explicit.')       - avg less than 0.2 milliseconds per call\n\t* seedrandom('explicit.', true) - avg less than 0.2 milliseconds per call\n\t* seedrandom() with crypto      - avg less than 0.2 milliseconds per call\n\t\n\tAutoseeding without crypto is somewhat slower, about 20-30 milliseconds on\n\ta 2012 windows 7 1.5ghz i5 laptop, as seen on Firefox 19, IE 10, and Opera.\n\tSeeded rng calls themselves are fast across these browsers, with slowest\n\tnumbers on Opera at about 0.0005 ms per seeded Math.random().\n\t\n\t\n\tLICENSE (MIT)\n\t-------------\n\t\n\tCopyright 2014 David Bau.\n\t\n\tPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\n\ta copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\t\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\n\twithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\n\tdistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\n\tpermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\n\tthe following conditions:\n\t\n\tThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\n\tincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\t\n\tTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\n\tEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\n\tMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\n\tIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\n\tCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\n\tTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\n\tSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\t\n\t*/\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * All code is in an anonymous closure to keep the global namespace clean.\n\t */\n\t(function (global, pool, math, width, chunks, digits, module, define, rngname) {\n\t\n\t  //\n\t  // The following constants are related to IEEE 754 limits.\n\t  //\n\t  var startdenom = math.pow(width, chunks),\n\t      significance = math.pow(2, digits),\n\t      overflow = significance * 2,\n\t      mask = width - 1,\n\t      nodecrypto;\n\t\n\t  //\n\t  // seedrandom()\n\t  // This is the seedrandom function described above.\n\t  //\n\t  var impl = math['seed' + rngname] = function (seed, options, callback) {\n\t    var key = [];\n\t    options = options == true ? { entropy: true } : options || {};\n\t\n\t    // Flatten the seed string or build one from local entropy if needed.\n\t    var shortseed = mixkey(flatten(options.entropy ?

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n\t// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n\t// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n\t// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n\t//\n\t// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n\t// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n\t// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n\t// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n\t//\n\t// Here's how this works:\n\t//\n\t// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n\t// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n\t// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n\t// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n\t// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n\t//\n\t// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n\t// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n\t// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n\t// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n\t// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n\t// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n\t//\n\t// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n\t// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n\t// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n\t// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n\t// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n\t// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n\t// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n\t// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n\t// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n\t// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n\t// cause the system to run out of memory.\n\t//\n\t// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n\t// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n\t// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\t\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tmodule.exports = Transform;\n\t\n\tvar Duplex = __webpack_require__(141);\n\t\n\t/*<replacement>*/\n\tvar util = __webpack_require__(138);\n\tutil.inherits = __webpack_require__(132);\n\t/*</replacement>*/\n\t\n\tutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\t\n\tfunction TransformState(stream) {\n\t  this.afterTransform = function (er, data) {\n\t    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  this.needTransform = false;\n\t  this.transforming = false;\n\t  this.writecb = null;\n\t  this.writechunk = null;\n\t  this.writeencoding = null;\n\t}\n\t\n\tfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n\t  var ts = stream._transformState;\n\t  ts.transforming = false;\n\t\n\t  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\t\n\t  if (!cb) return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\t\n\t  ts.writechunk = null;\n\t  ts.writecb = null;\n\t\n\t  if (data !== null && data !== undefined) stream.push(data);\n\t\n\t  cb(er);\n\t\n\t  var rs = stream._readableState;\n\t  rs.reading = false;\n\t  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n\t    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n\t  }\n\t}\n\t\n\tfunction Transform(options) {\n\t  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\t\n\t  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\t\n\t  this._transformState = new TransformState(this);\n\t\n\t  var stream = this;\n\t\n\t  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n\t  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\t\n\t  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n\t  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n\t  // sync guard flag.\n\t  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\t\n\t  if (options) {\n\t    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n\t\n\t    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n\t  this.once('prefinish', function () {\n\t    if (typeof this._flush === 'function') this._flush(function (er, data) {\n\t      done(stream, er, data);\n\t    });else done(stream);\n\t  });\n\t}\n\t\n\tTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n\t  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n\t  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n\t};\n\t\n\t// This is the part where you do stuff!\n\t// override this function in implementation classes.\n\t// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n\t//\n\t// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n\t// to the readable side.

If there is no\ncrypto support, seedrandom() uses the current time, the native rng,\nand a walk of several DOM objects to collect a few bits of entropy.\n\nEach time the one- or two-argument forms of seedrandom are called,\nentropy from the passed seed is accumulated in a pool to help generate\nfuture seeds for the zero- and two-argument forms of seedrandom.\n\nOn speed - This javascript implementation of Math.random() is several\ntimes slower than the built-in Math.random() because it is not native\ncode, but that is typically fast enough.  Some details (timings on\nChrome 25 on a 2010 vintage macbook):\n\n* seeded Math.random()          - avg less than 0.0002 milliseconds per call\n* seedrandom('explicit.')       - avg less than 0.2 milliseconds per call\n* seedrandom('explicit.', true) - avg less than 0.2 milliseconds per call\n* seedrandom() with crypto      - avg less than 0.2 milliseconds per call\n\nAutoseeding without crypto is somewhat slower, about 20-30 milliseconds on\na 2012 windows 7 1.5ghz i5 laptop, as seen on Firefox 19, IE 10, and Opera.\nSeeded rng calls themselves are fast across these browsers, with slowest\nnumbers on Opera at about 0.0005 ms per seeded Math.random().\n\n\nLICENSE (MIT)\n-------------\n\nCopyright 2014 David Bau.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n*/\n\n/**\n * All code is in an anonymous closure to keep the global namespace clean.\n */\n(function (\n    global, pool, math, width, chunks, digits, module, define, rngname) {\n\n//\n// The following constants are related to IEEE 754 limits.\n//\nvar startdenom = math.pow(width, chunks),\n    significance = math.pow(2, digits),\n    overflow = significance * 2,\n    mask = width - 1,\n    nodecrypto;\n\n//\n// seedrandom()\n// This is the seedrandom function described above.\n//\nvar impl = math['seed' + rngname] = function(seed, options, callback) {\n  var key = [];\n  options = (options == true) ? { entropy: true } : (options || {});\n\n  // Flatten the seed string or build one from local entropy if needed.\n  var shortseed = mixkey(flatten(\n    options.entropy ?

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\nfunction TransformState(stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function (er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n  this.writeencoding = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb) return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (data !== null && data !== undefined) stream.push(data);\n\n  cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(this);\n\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  if (options) {\n    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n\n    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n  }\n\n  // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  this.once('prefinish', function () {\n    if (typeof this._flush === 'function') this._flush(function (er, data) {\n      done(stream, er, data);\n    });else done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.
